        <p>"Working with Hazel was truly an enjoyable and hassle-free process from start to finish. She talked me through concepts, ideas, and explained the reasons she felt the way she did concerning functionality and design, which was great because I realized there was much more to creating a website than I had ever imagined. She really knows her stuff, both in the technical aspects, and the logic behind doing what she did. All the while, she still made me feel like the website was mine, allowed me to make all the final calls and enjoy the process from a creative side while she went about implementing what we’d discussed. Websites are easy to make, but really great websites take a lot of know-how and a solid understanding of surfer habits, accessibility, layout, and design. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Hazel on my website and feel extremely confident in her abilities and couldn’t be happier with how I was treated as a client in all respects and with my new website."</p>

        <p>One of the earliest WordPress websites that I built was for myself in 2011 and hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). I used the Genesis Framework and modified a previous version of the Genesis Minimum Pro theme. I used the following in the site:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Phtotoshop</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>WordPress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The site is no longer live as I am currently re-branding everything now that I got married.</p>
